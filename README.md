# Data Gallery
Broad gallery of data visualizations resulting from a three-step (acquire/wrangle/visualize) process. This is somewhat related to the [Confounder](https://github.com/analyticascent/confounder) project, though the focus is on getting data and visualizing it rather than implement any machine learning techniques.

The "hello world" example in this repo is scraping this webpage from the National Center for Education Statistics to produce a Bokeh chart of [this data](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d15/tables/dt15_236.55.asp) for the X-axis and [these outcomes](https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/) for the Y-axis.
